"""The UnitTest API Adapter.

This 'simulates' the sort of responses you can expect from the DM API/Model.
It stimulates a Database by using dictionaries that are pickled to (and unpickled from)
the file system after acquiring a lock object. Pickling is required to
(because it's a simple built-in mechanism in Python) to persist data
between processes in the multi-processing framework we run in because we ultimately need
to simulate the multi-pod messaging-based framework of the DM.

A separate pickle file is used for each 'simulated' model table and the object
initialiser resets all the pickle files (located in 'tests/pickle-files').

Job definitions are loaded (statically) from the content of the
'tests/job-definitions/job-definitions.yaml' file and yielded through the 'get_job()'
method.
