# Job definitions used exclusively for unit testing.
# They provide sufficient information to 'masquerade' as real jobs
# and are served up by the UnitTestAPIAdapter (in 'tests/api_adapter.py').
#
# This offers bare-essential definitions that are used simply to test
# the workflow engine. It does not fully comply with the Job definition schema -
# only those parts that we need for testing the Workflow Engine.
#
# All jobs used for unit testing are defined in this file.
#
# The 'command' module is expected to be found implemented as a Python 3 module in the
# 'tests/jobs' directory. So the smiles-to-file 'command' module ('smiles-to-file.py')
# must be placed in the 'jobs' directory, and it must comply with the variables
# defined here.
#
# Jobs are executed in the 'project-root/project-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
# directory that is created (and wiped) by the UnitTestInstanceLauncher
# (in 'tests/instance_launcher.py').
