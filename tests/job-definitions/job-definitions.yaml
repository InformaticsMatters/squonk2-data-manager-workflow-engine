# Job definitions used exclusively for unit testing.
# They provide sufficient information to 'masquerade' as real jobs
# and are served up by the UnitTestDatabaseAdapter (found in the tests directory).
#
# This offers bare-essential job definitions that are used to test
# the workflow engine. It does not fully comply with the Job definition schema -
# only those that we need for testing the Workflow Engine.
#
# All jobs used for unit testing must be defined in this file.
#
# For each job you must provide: -
# - Job command
#
# The command is meaningless as the job that is run is expected to be
# a Python 3 module called <job>.py in the tests/jobs directory.
# So a nop job would have a corresponding Python module called nop.py.
# The test instance_launcher module will run the job.
