A package that simplifies the validation and decoding of Data Manager
Workflow definitions.

Installation (Python)
=====================

The Job decoder is published on `PyPI`_ and can be installed from there:

    pip install im-data-manager-workflow-engine

Once installed you can validate the workflow definition (expected to be a dictionary
formed from the definition YAML file) with:

    >>> from workflow import decoder
    >>> error: Optional[str] = decoder.validate_schema(workflow)

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/im-data-manager-workflow-engine

Contributing
============

The project's written in Python and uses `Poetry`_ for dependency and package
management. We also use `pre-commit`_ to manage our pre-commit hooks, which
rely on `black`_, `mypy`_, `pylint`_, amongst others.

Create your environment::

    poetry shell
    poetry install --with dev
    pre-commit install -t commit-msg -t pre-commit

And then start by running the pre-commit hooks to ensure you're stating with a
_clean_ project::

    pre-commit run --all-files

And then run the tests::

    coverage run -m pytest
    coverage report
