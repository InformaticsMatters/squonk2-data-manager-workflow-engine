"""The WorkflowEngine execution logic.

It responds to Pod and Workflow protocol buffer messages received by its
'handle_message()' function, messages delivered by the message handler in the PBC Pod.
There are no other methods in this class.

Its role is to translate a pre-validated workflow definition into the ordered execution
of step "Jobs" that manifest as Pod "Instances" that run in a project directory in the
DM.

Workflow messages initiate (START) and terminate (STOP) workflows. Pod messages signal
the end of individual workflow steps and carry the exit code of the executed Job.
The engine used START messages to launch the first "step" in a workflow and the Pod
messages to signal the success (or failure) of a prior step. A step's success is used,
along with it's original workflow definition to determine the next action
(run the next step or signal the end of the workflow).

Before a START message is transmitted the author (typically the Workflow Validator)
will have created a RunningWorkflow record in the DM. The ID of this record is passed
in the START message that is sent. The engine uses this ID to find the running workflow
and the workflow. The engine creates RunningWorkflowStep records for each step that
is executed, and it uses thew InstanceLauncher to launch the Job (a Pod) for each step.
